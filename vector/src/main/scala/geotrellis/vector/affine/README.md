#geotrellis.vector.affine

The contents of this package define affine transformations over the geometric entities of `geotrellis.vector`. [Affine transformations](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AffineTransformation.html) preserve the proportions of lines (both those that constitute the geometry of interest and any lines which *could* be drawn between them).

The affine transformations we've defined as methods on `geotrellis.vector.Geometry` objects include: reflection, rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation.
